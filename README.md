# HowToAsk
the guidelines fellow comes from IRC: #debian@chat.freenode.net

1) Read the /topic, the FAQ, and google before asking us.   
2) Don't ask to ask, just ask.  
3) Don't repeat; show that you have tried to help yourself by refining the question.   
4) Reading documentation (man/info pages, READMEs) is a worthwhile skill, practice it. 
5) Use /msg to talk to the bots (not the people), see &lt;msg>. 
6) Be polite and patient.  
7) Paste into a &lt;pastebin>, not here. 
8) No trolls or spam. 
9) see &lt;code of conduct>
